# Active and Passive Voice

There are two types of passive voice in Sanskrit - Transitive Passive (कर्मणि) and Intransitive Passive (भावे).

## Transitive Passive (कर्मणि)

In transitive passive sentences the object of the transitive action is the syntactic focus and not the agent of the action. The verb undergo modification as if it were a 4th conjugation (गण) आत्मनेपद. The verb agrees with the object in number (वचन) and person (पुरुष). The object of a passive action should be in प्रथमा विभक्ति (nominative case) and the agent should be in तृतीया विभक्ति (instrumental case).

**Active:** रामो गृहम् गच्छति। Rama goes home.

**Passive:** रामेण गृहम् गम्यते। (Note that गृहम् here is प्रथमा विभक्ति) Home is gone to by Rama.

**Active:** रामो भूमिम् खनति। Rama digs the ground.

**Passive:** रामेण भूमिः खन्यते। The ground is dug by Rama.

**Active:** अहं पुत्रान् पश्यामि। I see (my) sons.

**Passive:** मया पुत्राः दृश्यन्ते। (My) sons are seen by me.

**Active:** त्वम् भार्याम् स्मरसि। You remember your wife

**Passive:** त्वया भार्या स्मर्यते। (Your) wife is remembered by you.

Passive sentences can of course be of different types. Examples of present, past imperfect, imperfect and potential sentences in passive voice.
